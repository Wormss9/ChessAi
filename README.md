Pgn files of Carlsen's games are read and moves are translated into array notated board states, each number representing a specific piece and array index representing its position. Then arrays are serialized into .csv-s of Carlsen's moves and respective previous board states. Upon these .csv-s a neural network is deployed, taking board states as an input and moves as an output.
