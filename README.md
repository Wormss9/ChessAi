# ChessAi
In this project, a chess engine that can emulate plays of master players is being developed.

Currently, development of a Javascript engine that is making sure that every play is in accordance with the rules is in progress as well as development of a Python trained bot, that is trained on a dataset of games of Magnus Carlsen.
